# Abstract

Regulators are used in time-sensitive networks in order to reshape traffic reducing the burstiness
generated by the aggregation systems within the network. Regulators, in terms of the IEEE
TSN group are defined as Asynchronous Traffic Shaping or what in the literature is known
as interleaved regulators. These regulators are placed before a multiplexing stage, shaping the
outgoing traffic and cancelling the increased burstiness, allowing calculations of the worst-case
delay to be performed. One of the main properties studied for regulators implies that they
do not increase the worst-case delay in the network. So far, all the studies were performed
assuming ideal clocks within the network. However, a recently published paper underlines
the importance of taking into account non-ideal clocks while studying interleaved regulators
properties, providing a theoretical proof that under certain circumstances, interleaved regulators
can lead to system instability due to the unbounded delay through them. This thesis intends to
continue with this study, providing a simulation proof that shows instability when interleaved
regulators are simulated assuming non-ideal clocks. This is carried out in the network simulator
ns-3. Along with the different developed modules, two are highlighted: local time and ATS
modules. The former introduces the notion of local times in ns-3, whereas the latter implements
regulators functionality in ns-3, following the implementation proposed by the IEEE TSN.
